Biodiveristy Capstone Project - Investigating Protected Species


  Biodiversity Project

Welcome to the Introduction to Data Analysis Biodiversity Capstone project!

You are a biodiversity analyst working for the National Parks Service.
You have been given a CSV file species_info.csv with data about
different species in our National Parks, including:

  * The scientific name of each species
  * The common names of each species
  * The species conservation status

    /(CSV data based on data from the National Parks Service.)/

The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis
on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if
there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become
endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot
data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaning way.

Let's get started!

/

/Instructions
*1.

*

You'll need |pandas| and |matplotlib| for this project. Import both modules.

/

/
Stuck? Get a hint

The standard is to import pandas as |pd| and import pyplot from
matplotlibs as |plt|.

*2.

*

Load species_info.csv into a DataFrame called |species|.

/

/
Stuck? Get a hint

The command to load a CSV is |pd.read_csv()|.

*3.

*

Print and inspect the DataFrame by using |.head()|.

What kind of information is contained in this DataFrame?
