Biodiveristy Capstone Project - Investigating Protected Species


  Foot and Mouth Reduction Effort - Final Thoughts

What do the results of the last exercise tell us?

Given a baseline of 15% occurrence of foot and mouth disease in sheep at
Bryce National Park, you found that if the scientists wanted to be sure
that a >5% drop in observed cases of foot and mouth disease in the sheep
at Yellowstone was significant they would have to observe at least 870
sheep.

Then, using the observation data you analyzed earlier, you found that
this would take approximately one week of observing in Yellowstone to
see that many sheep, or approximately two weeks in Bryce to see that
many sheep.

Congratulations! You've completed Part 2 of the Biodiversity at National
Parks Data Analysis Project!

Consider this, starting from only two DataFrames containing species
information and species sightings, you were able to create several
informative visualizations, perform chi-squared tests to answer the
question: "Are some species more likely to be endangered than others?",
determine the best place to observe sheep, and calculate the sample size
necessary for confident measurements in a disease reduction study.

And that is only scratching the surface of what those two DataFrames can
offer. Once you can master the tools and techniques of Data Analysis,
every set of data becomes a hundred new stories that you can discover
and share. Keep Exploring.
